Paneer Contamination Detection Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Deep Learning by Divya P, Nadia Naureen, Tannya Pasricha

This project focuses on detecting chemical contamination in paneer (Indian cottage cheese) using Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and YOLOv11n, a state-of-the-art deep learning model.
The goal is to build a non-destructive, automated, and accurate detection system by analyzing reflectance variations in hyperspectral bands.

Problem Statement:
Food contamination is a major concern in the dairy industry.
Traditional methods like manual inspection or chemical testing are slow, destructive, and unreliable.

This project aims to develop an automated, hyperspectral deep-learning pipeline to detect contamination based on spectral changes.

Project Workflow:

1) Sample Preparation
2) Storage at Room Temperature
3) Hyperspectral Image Capture
4) Pre-processing in Google Colab
5) Band Visualization (80 Bands)
6) PCA / Band Selection
7) YOLOv11n Model Training
8) Detection & Evaluation
